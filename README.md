# iOS-Project-1

This project has 5 different tasks:

1/ Write a fxn that takes an array of ints, separates into odd/even numbers, sorts, returns evens and odds as a tuple
2/ Takes in two parameters: an Array of Strings and a String to find
   Locates the index of the string to find, if it exists in the array
   Returns an optional string one position later in the array than the string to find
3/ Write a function that generates a url string for making an HTTP GET request.
4/ Write a function that takes in a camel-case string and returns an integer representing the number of words in the string
5/ Write a fxn that takes in a range of numbers and prints all prime numbers between that range.
